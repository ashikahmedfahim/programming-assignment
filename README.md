open the project folder then open a terminal type:
cd fronetend
npm install
npm start
open another terminal while in the main project folder
cd backend
npm install
node index

now the project is up and running 
upVote and DownVote is not working in the frontend but using postman it is working.
and for the time shorage there are some issues like after registration you have to manually go to login page 
and then you can login.
